# üñºÔ∏è Image Data Analysis - Fashion-MNIST

## üìä Dataset Overview

**Fashion-MNIST** is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

### Dataset Details:
- **Training samples**: 60,000
- **Test samples**: 10,000  
- **Image size**: 28√ó28 pixels
- **Channels**: 1 (grayscale)
- **Classes**: 10 fashion categories

### Fashion Categories:
0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
4. Coat
5. Sandal
6. Shirt
7. Sneaker
8. Bag
9. Ankle boot

## ü§ñ Algorithms Implemented

### Traditional Machine Learning:
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Instance-based learning
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble method with decision trees
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Kernel-based classification
4. **Logistic Regression** - Linear classification model

### Deep Learning:
5. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** - Custom architecture with multiple conv layers

## üìÅ Files

- `02_Image_Data_Complete.ipynb` - Complete analysis notebook
- `image/` - Generated visualizations and plots

## üöÄ Running the Analysis

1. **Open the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 02_Image_Data_Complete.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run all cells** to:
   - Load and explore the Fashion-MNIST dataset
   - Train all algorithms
   - Generate performance comparisons
   - Export results to JSON

3. **View dashboard**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run ../streamlit_app/02_Image_Data.py
   ```

## üìä Expected Results

The CNN typically achieves the highest accuracy (~92%) but requires the most training time. Traditional ML algorithms achieve 84-88% accuracy with much faster training times, making them suitable for quick prototyping.

## üîß Key Features

- **Comprehensive comparison** of traditional ML vs deep learning
- **Performance metrics** including accuracy, training time, and confusion matrices
- **Visualization** of sample images, class distributions, and results
- **Export functionality** for Streamlit dashboard integration
- **Reproducible results** with fixed random seeds
