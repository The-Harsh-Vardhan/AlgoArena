# Contributing to AlgoArena

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AlgoArena! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs
- Provide detailed information about the problem
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
- Specify your environment (Python version, OS, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

- Check if the feature has already been suggested
- Provide a clear description of the feature
- Explain why it would be beneficial
- Consider implementation complexity

### Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your feature
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

#### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and small

#### Adding New Algorithms

When adding new ML algorithms:

1. Include proper documentation
2. Add performance evaluation
3. Update the comparison dashboard
4. Test on the existing datasets
5. Include references to algorithm papers/sources

#### Adding New Data Domains

For new data types (e.g., video, 3D data):

1. Create a new folder with appropriate structure
2. Include a comprehensive README
3. Provide sample datasets or links
4. Implement multiple algorithms
5. Create visualizations for results

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR has a clear title and description
2. Link to any relevant issues
3. Include tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Ensure all existing tests still pass
