### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate

**Example:**

```python
def preprocess_data(df: pd.DataFrame, target_column: str) -> Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series, str]:
    """
    Preprocess the input DataFrame for machine learning.

    Args:
        df: Input DataFrame
        target_column: Name of the target variable column

    Returns:
        Tuple of (features, target, problem_type)
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Streamlit Code Style

- Use consistent naming for Streamlit components
- Add helpful tooltips and descriptions
- Implement proper error handling
- Use progress bars for long operations

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Use proper markdown formatting
